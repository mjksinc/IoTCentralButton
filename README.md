# Overview
Something as simple as a button can have powerful actions when connected to Azure. In this example, you'll be connecting a physcial teXXmo button to Microsoft's new software-as-a-service application, IoT Central. The button will trigger an alert if pressed 3 times within a short time frame. You'll learn how to deploy your own IoT Central application, create device templates, and use the Device Provisioning Service to connect the teXXmo button to your application.

## Setting Up IoT Central
1. Head on over to the the [IoT Central Homepage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/iot-central/) to learn more or select [Getting Started](https://apps.azureiotcentral.com/) to begin creating your application.

13. Congratualations! You've successfully created a real device in IoT Central and configured a rule to be actioned based on events from the button

## Generating a SAS Token using Device Provisioning Service
1. On the same page as your Measurement and Rule creation, select *Connect* at the top right of screen This will generate credentials for you to create a connection string through the **Azure Device Provisioning Service (DPS)**.

![IoT Central - Connect](https://github.com/mjksinc/ButtonGuide-Dev/blob/master/images/image3.2.png)

2. Save the following credentials for later use:
   - Under **Device Connection**, copy the *Scope ID* and *Device ID*
   - Under **Credentials**, select *Shared Access Signature*, then copy the *Primary ID*
   - Select *Close* when complete
   
 ![IoT Central - Credentials](https://github.com/mjksinc/ButtonGuide-Dev/blob/master/images/image3.3.png)
   
3. A DPS client will now need to be installed to generate the Connection String for the real device. Install the **DPS Key Generator** (ds-keygen) through your Command Line Interface by following the instructions on the [DPS-KeyGen GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Azure/dps-keygen)

4. Now, install the platform-specific dps_cstr tool as instructed on the [dps_cstr tool GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Azure/dps-keygen/tree/master/bin)

5. Execute the following command, replacing the arguments with the credentials you saved in Step 2 above.

```dps_cstr <Scope ID> <Device ID> <Primary ID>```

7. Copy the entire output of this command and save your later use. Your saved output should look similar to the string below:

```HostName=saas-iothub-51aa-dfd7-42a1-8c-d7568a236.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=sw9u;SharedAccessKey=UJQKvC4sfHEMbFztcbD3xEDadHHVIFk=```

6. Now you've generated your connection string, it's time to connect your teXXmo button!

# TeXXmo Button
**Note:** these steps are also available under "*Getting Started*" [on the teXXmo page](https://catalog.azureiotsolutions.com/details?title=teXXmo-IoT-Button&source=home-page) of the Azure Device Catalog

## Configuring your button
1. Put the teXXmo button into Access Point (AP) mode by pressing and holding the button for 6 seconds. The LED will change to a yellow flashing strobe, then to a pulsing red.
    **Note:** if the button begins to rapidly flash green, wait until it stops, then try again.
    
2. Open the network connection settings on your desktop and select the wifi network beginning with *ESP_XX:XX:XX* (The numbers will match the MAC address of your button). The light will continue to pulse red while in AP mode. 
    **Note:** this will disconnect you from the internet
    
3. Open a web browser and go to *192.168.4.1*. You should arrive at the homepage for your button.
